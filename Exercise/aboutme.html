<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>I'm originally from Honduras, a very small country in Central America, mostly known for its amazing scuba diving and Mayan culture, amongst other riches. My family and I moved to Chicago when I was young and I have called it home since. I'm very rooted in culture, love to travel, cooking is one of my hobbies, love being around people and have a passion for design. Often times my friends refer to me as a Renaissance woman as I love the arts.</p>
