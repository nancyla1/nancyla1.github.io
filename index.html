<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p>I'm originally from Honduras, a very small country in Central America and my family and I moved to Chicago when I was young. This has been home for many years and it is the city that has taught me a lot about culture, diversity, architecture, community needs, world-view approach and most importantly user or human design centricity for products, services and the built environment.
